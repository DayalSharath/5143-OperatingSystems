# YO-Shell (Your Own Shell) 
Due: TBD

# Not COMPLETE

## Overview

Your going to write your own command line interpreter using python. Your interpreter will implement a subset of the existing bash
commands that we use. We could do this in pretty much any language, in fact, "C" would be the language of choice if this were to 
be something that we would release to market, however, Python is a pretty stout language and will simplify the implementation of your
own Shell. 

## Requirements

The following list of commands will be implemented:
- `ls`  (file listing)
    - Flags:
        - `-l`
- `cp` (copy command)
- `mv` (rename command)
- `chmod` (change modify)
- ...
